<h1>Welcome to the Chuck Norris Joke Generator project!</h1>

<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>This project is based around nothing more than a care free desire to work with a simple API. I found this API online and thought to myself, "Why not?". The API is available <a href="https://api.chucknorris.io">here</a>, and is a simple JSON RESTful API to get Chuck Norris jokes (reffered to as facts). Sure, Chuck Norris jokes are outdated, but hey, it's something lighthearted and a simple to practice interacting with an API!</p>

<h3>Update: Project Completed!</h3>
<p>I am happy to announce that I have finished troubleshooting and the site now works! Of course, this has just been a silly project, but I did it to practice some very real and important skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Working with APIs
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Getting and parsing JSON data</li>
      <li><em>Using Axiom: I didn't know what this was before this project!</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Building an angular app
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with both Node and Angular together (learned to build angular and deploy the dist folder the build creates with express)
      <li>Getting and parsing JSON data</li>
      <li>Cross-component data sharing (check how I send the category and joke information between components!)</li>
      <li>Building custom services</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Responsive design
  </li>

  <li>
    Fundamental JavaScript Principles
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Getting and passing event data without jQuery </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>So all in all, a silly project but gave me some good practice and I even learned a thing or two.</p>

<h3>Happy coding!</h3>
